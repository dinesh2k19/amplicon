## Rhizosphere microbiome 

The host plant root ecosystem, microorganisms and the soil forms below the ground rhizo-microbiome environment in the rhizosphere soil of the associated host plant species. Microorganisms comprising the associated biomes deliberately modulate the mutual relationships with distinct genomic attributes improving the overall fitness in specific ecological and environmental habitats including the pathogenic behavior and symbiosis. 

Identification of the natural host microbial diversity is key features of the understanding the host plant rhizomicrobiome interaction dynamics. These interactions play pivotal role in plant adaption and ecological behavior of the most widely distributed plant species across the world.
